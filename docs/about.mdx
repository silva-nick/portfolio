# About me

### Introduction

I started coding in my junior year of high school, following in the footsteps of my older sister. Ever since, I've read my way through the internet trying to learn as much as I can. Four years later and I'm now a rising junior studying Data Science + Economics. Although my coursework widely consists of studies in mathematics and statistical science, my passion for coding and developing software leads me to commit a majority of my time to learning more traditional computer science subjects. Check out [`/docs/timeline`](/docs/timeline) for some more info about me.
