After a few weeks of development, tweaking, and learning I am finally proud to announce my website and the first functional version of [`docusaurus-portfolio`](https://github.com/silva-nick/docusaurus-portfolio). I started this project as a way to learn about Docusaurus's code base while also spending time crafting my own personal site.

So, what's up with `docusaurus-portfolio`? Although it started out as a pet project, as I've continued to add more features and expanded the project, I've quickly grown to hope that the plugin can assist other developers. The sole goal of `docusaurus-portfolio` is to help fellow developers add a personal touch to their documentation websites or build an entire portfolio website in minutes.

What's next? I hope that `docusaurus-portfolio` will continue to grow over time, but its main purpose as a plugin to help me create my website is complete and I think I'll move on to other things in the near future. As always, contributions of any form are welcome.
