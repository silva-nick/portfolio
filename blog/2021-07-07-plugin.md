## Introduction

One of Docusaurus's best features is its growing library of open-source plugins and themes. Before starting your plugin, check out the [officially supported](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins) and [community maintained](https://docusaurus.io/community/resources#community-plugins) plugins already available. Although there are already a lot of plugins on the market, there are still many that haven't been written. This guide should help take you along the path of development.

### General overview of Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a React-based documentation website platform supported by Facebook. There are a lot of documentation and website platforms already available, so why choose Docusaurus? On their homepage they claim that Docusaurus supports using markdown or `mdx` for writing pages, using custom React components, creating versioned websites for different releases, easy translation, and built-in content search. From a development perspective, Docusaurus allows the user to be as involved as they want. The most simple Docusaurus sites don't have to go beyond simple markdown repositories. What's great about Docusaurus, however, is the simplicity of using React to define custom components and plugins to fill those components with data.

#### Docusaurus from a user's perspective

To get started with Docusaurus, the best place to start is [their introduction documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next). The easiest way to quickly get started is to run:

```bash
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
...
cd my-website
npx docusaurus start
```

As a user, there are a couple of file's and directories that are useful to get familiar with.

- `docusaurus.config.js`: This is where all the main configuration for your Docusaurus site should go. In this file you're able to change the website routing, sitebar styling, title, and other aspects of the ui generally already handled for you.
- `/docs`: The docs directory is where all of your documentation files should be placed. Whether `md` or `mdx`, by adding different files in docs, Docusaurus will generate pages in your site containing the new documentation. For more custom control of the sidebar as well as other aspects of the documentation ui, check out `docusaurus.config.js`.
- `/blog`: The blog directory, like the docs one, serves to hold all of the `md` or `mdx` blog posts that you want to be hosted on your website.
- `/src`: Now things start to get interesting. The `src` directory holds a bunch of cool places to customize your Docusaurus site. By default `/css` contains a global css script that will be used across all of your site. This can be useful to update colors, fonts, or styling specific components. `pages` holds `index.js` the default page of your website.
- `/static/img`: All images used in your blog or documentation should find there home in `/static/img`. From here they can be referenced like `![My Image](/img/blog/my_image.png)`.

**Note:** for more information on any of these topics check out the [Docusaurus official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/creating-pages).

#### Some general vocabulary to get started:

- Plugin: external code that implements Docusaurus's lifecycle APIs. _Plugins_ are generally server-side and can be used to fetch data, generate routes and pages, or load external code into your project. One singular plugin could implement the lifecycle api and have both server-side and frontend components.
- Theme: a term used to differentiate frontend specific plugins. These often contain React components and must furfill the _theme_ lifecycle api.
- Preset: a plugin that helps combine and configure different presets of plugins and themes.
- Init: general term used to describe cli-based Docusaurus initialization packages.

#### Anatomy of a plugin

Throughout the rest of this blog post, I will be referencing the plugin used to design this site ([`docusaurus-portfolio`](https://github.com/silva-nick/docusaurus-portfolio)). At any time, feel free to check out the source if you think that would be useful.

In its most simple form, a plugin is a function that supports specific parts of the Docusaurus lifecycle api. So, before continuing here, I highly recommend reading through the official [lifecycle api documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/lifecycle-apis) to get a general feel of what you can accomplish through a plugin.

### Managing multi-package projects

In most cases, plugins will be npm packages that users can access and install from the command line. Moreover, if you want so support independent initialization and theme plugins, then your singular _plugin_ may end up as 2-3 npm packages.

#### Using Lerna

[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is a super useful npm package manager that helps seamlessly develop and release multiple packages. To get started with Lerna, install it using npm and then initialize a Lerna project.

```bash
npm install --global lerna
...
lerna init
```

This should walk you through generating a `lerna.json` file that is maintained at root. Now, whenever you want to publish your packages to the node package manager, simply commit all changes and then run `lerna publish`. For more detailed instructions and more commands available, check out the [Lerna documentation](https://lerna.js.org/).

#### Multi-package TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful tool for creating and maintaining large JS codebases. For those who don't know, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that includes static type definitions (i.e. it makes you specify all of your variable's types before you run the program, like Java or C). Although static typing doesn't seem like a big change, adding types improves documentation/ readability and helps catch simple errors before they happen. If you don't have much TypeScript experience, however, managing TypeScript configuration and learning some of the tricks of the language can be quite invested.

For those interested in using TypeScript, I, although far from a TS expert myself, have a few notes that might make things easier in this multi-package scenario.

1. Specify project wide TypeScript config (`tsconfig.json`) in your root directory and then extend it in your packages. In my case, extending the root config looked like:

```json
{
    "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

1. Set up default exclude config to avoid messy mistakes. In your root `tsconfig`, make sure to specify what places you want your TS compiler to exclude so that you don't end up accidentally compiling or overwriting files that you wanted ignored. For example, your exclude property may have: `"**/tests/**"` or `"**/node_modules/**"`.

1. Make your root config as strict as possible and only loosen TS constraints as needed. TypeScript has a lot of options to increase and decrease the thoroughness of its linting. Take advantage of this by specifying strict defaults and then loosen them in package-specific contexts as needed. Some options you might want to set include: `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noImplicitReturns`, and `noImplicitAny`.

1. If you're working on a plugin that contains React components there are two things you need to consider: 1) should you write your components in TypeScript, and 2) how can you set up TS for working with React. There is no good answer to the first question, TS offers the same benefits in React programming as it does to normal JS. The only catch is that with complicated and fast moving projects, spending the intensive time to support TSX components often becomes more tedious than useful. Then, if you decide to use default jsx, there are a couple of things you want to make sure you have set up. First, make sure `allowJs` is set to true so that TS won't flag when it sees your js files. Then, make sure `jsx` is set to `react` to tell TypeScript that you're using React for your project.

1. Lastly, make sure you add all your needed Node package for supporting TypeScript. Some of these you will definitely need include: `@docusaurus/types`, `@types/node`, and `typescript`.

These are just a few things to get you started on using TypeScript to write a plugin, if you're interested in learning more definitely check out the source code for [`docusaurus-portfolio`]() and [`docusaurus-plugin-content-blog`](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/master/packages/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog).
